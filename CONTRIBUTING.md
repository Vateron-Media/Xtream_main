# Contributing to the Project

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Follow these guidelines to make the process smooth for everyone.

## 📌 General Guidelines
- Minimally use AI
- Follow the project's coding style and best practices.
- Ensure your changes are well-documented.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single change.
- If you are refactoring and are not sure if the code is unused elsewhere, comment it out. It will be removed after the release.

## 🛠️ Customizing the development environment
Unfortunately you will have to install the panel on the server completely. It does not have a developer mode
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   sudo apt install git
   git clone https://github.com/Vateron-Media/Xtream_install
   cd Xtream_install/
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the installation:
   ```sh
   sudo python3 install.py
   ```

## ✨ Code Standards
- Use **K&R** coding style for PHP.
- Follow best practices for Python and Bash scripts.
- Avoid unused functions and redundant code.

## 🧪 Writing and Running Tests
- Write unit tests for PHP scripts.
- To run tests:
  ```sh
  /bin/php /home/xc_vm/bin/php/bin/phpunit-9.6.21.phar --configuration /home/xc_vm/tests/phpunit.xml 
  ```
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PRs.
